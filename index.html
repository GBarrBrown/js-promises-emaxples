    <h1>JS Promises Examples</h1>
    <h4>This is a test ground for me to get a better grip of Javascript Promises</h4>
    <h4>To get an idea of what is actually happening, open up the chrome console in devtools (f12)</h4>

    <h3>What is a promise?</h3>
    <p>"A promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an operation"</p>
    <p>An object can be in one of three states: Pending, Resolved or Rejected</p>
    <button onclick="showPendingPromise()">create & show a <strong>pending</strong> promise</button><br />
    <button onclick="showResolvedPromise()">create & show a <strong>resolved</strong> promise</button><br />
    <button onclick="createRejectedPromise()">create & show a <strong>rejected</strong> promise</button><br />

    <h3>Why use promises?</h3>
    <p>Promises are non-blocking, meaning that while a promise is in its pending state other code can still execute (even other promises)</p>
    <p>This can be demonstrated by starting a 5 second wait, then immediately starting a 1 second wait</p>
    <p>The 5 second wait is still going to come back with it's confirmation once after 5 seconds, but in the mean time we are free to call a 1 second wait</p>
    <button onclick="wait1sec()">wait 1 second</button>
    <br />
    <button onclick="wait5sec()">wait 5 seconds</button>
